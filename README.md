## Space X data analysis using IPA and BeautifullSoup with Python

### Abstract
  Space X is a private company that had lead in the last period of time the sub-orbital and orbital private space travel, Falcon 9, being the last and more succesfull project at the moment, as they have reduced the cost of putting its rockets in orbit into space, in comparisson with other companies, representing about a 38% of the cost incurred by the competition. This due the recovery of the first stage in the launching process (Falcon 9 have two stages that are separeted on the trayectory of the rocket), usin technology that will allow withstand reentry burns and the safety landing of the first stage.
  The idea of this project is to used two different tools to extract information about the space rocket launched by Space X, using an API and webscraping with BeautifulSoup, we will obtain the information of the Falcon 9 rocket launched, founding this data in the Space X webpage and in wikipedia, using the tool mention before respectively.
With this View, will be possible to analized different kind of information related with the rockets launched and create visualization to obtain insights trought its analysis and also determined if spacial X will reuse the first stage using the gathered data.

### Webscraping using API
 In the first part of this project the data was obtain using an API, for this matter jupyter notebook was used, getting great part of the code from the lab material given by IBM developers. This material was used to obtain the historical data, but at the same time dive deeper in the coding related with this task. 
 The code that includes analysis and personal insigths is in this link <a href= 'SpaceX_webscraping.ipynb'> Web Scraping using IPA </a>.
